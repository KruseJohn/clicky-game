# Clicky-Game
## Overview

This app is a memory game built with React and features 18 characters from South Park. The goal is not to click on any character more than once. If you select a character for a second time, the game will restart. If you successfully select each character once, the selected characters will reset and you can begin to play again.  Good Luck!
